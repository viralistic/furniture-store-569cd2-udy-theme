  The Belmont Collection was a collaborative creation with designer Brad Ascalon
  re-envisioning the traditional fabric shade lamp but with the warmth and
  preciousness of hand crafted furniture. Belmontâ€™s iconic, yet reductive form
  creates a natural canvas for displaying an exquisite array of textiles from
  premium wool to colorful woven fabrics that can be paired with a solid crafted
  oak wood armature. Belmont can be hung individually or in stunning groupings
  to provide warm and comfortable illumination to complement any residential,
  contract, or hospitality setting.
