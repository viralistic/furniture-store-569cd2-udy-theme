  Bel Occhio is a study in weightlessness and transparency,” notes designer
  Pablo Pardo on his inspiration for this luminaire. “It evokes nature’s
  transformative light.” His piece manifests the celestial through a hybrid
  design: its suspended, inner column creates focused illumination while its
  surrounding shell produces a transformative ambient glow. These symbiotic
  elements enable Bel Occhio to act as a multi-position spotlight and a source
  of atmospheric tenor. They also serve dynamic purposes: Bel Occhio is built as
  an infinitely adjustable table lamp and a suspended pendant model. Both
  elements serve to illuminate with comfort and fascinate the imagination.
