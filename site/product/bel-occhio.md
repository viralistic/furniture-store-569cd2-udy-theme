description: "Bel Occhio is a study in weightlessness and transparency,” notes designer Pablo Pardo on his inspiration for this luminaire. “It evokes nature’s transformative light.” His piece manifests the celestial through a hybrid design: its suspended, inner column creates focused illumination while its surrounding shell produces a transformative ambient glow. These symbiotic elements enable Bel Occhio to act as a multi-position spotlight and a source of atmospheric tenor. They also serve dynamic purposes: Bel Occhio is built as an infinitely adjustable table lamp and a suspended pendant model. Both elements serve to illuminate with comfort and fascinate the imagination."
