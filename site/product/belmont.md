description: "The Belmont Collection was a collaborative creation with designer Brad Ascalon re-envisioning the traditional fabric shade lamp but with the warmth and preciousness of hand crafted furniture. Belmontâ€™s iconic, yet reductive form creates a natural canvas for displaying an exquisite array of textiles from premium wool to colorful woven fabrics that can be paired with a solid crafted oak wood armature. Belmont can be hung individually or in stunning groupings to provide warm and comfortable illumination to complement any residential, contract, or hospitality setting."
