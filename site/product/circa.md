description: "In designing Circa, the Pablo Studio designers wanted to create a product that was revolutionary yet familiar. They not only created a new lamp, but also a new archetype for indoor lighting – one that blurs the boundary between the utilitarian work lamp and traditional shaded lamp. Circa’s defining feature is a flat-panel LED disc that moves fluidly above its axis point. This mobility allows the lamp to assume an infinite number of positions while functioning as a task lamp that provides balanced, ambient light. Circa also supports a user's mobile devices by integrating a USB charging port on the table, floor and wall models."
